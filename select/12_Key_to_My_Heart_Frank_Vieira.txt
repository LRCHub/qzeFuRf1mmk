Two for one Coors or Busch Light
Swiping left, swiping right
Simplest decision of my Thursday night
Before I spotted you

Walking up was easy small talk a breeze
Keep the tab open Bartender please
I can see you in my shotgun seat
Just reminding me that its been empty

'Cause I've been searching near and far
Drinking on forever in these small town bars
But sippin' from your lips got me falling hard
No I shouldn't drive take the key to my heart

And ride, yeah baby all night
We ain't got to think twice
We just need to push start
Take the key to my heart

We can punch the gas, take it slow
Anywhere you wanna go
You can drop me off or I can pull you close
Baby your in control

Loving you is easy just like a breeze
You and the Cuervo I'm weak in the knees
I might be riding in my shotgun seat
But your still next to me

'Cause I've been searching near and far
Drinking on forever in these small town bars
But sippin' from your lips got me falling hard
No I shouldn't drive take the key to my heart

Loving you is easy just like a breeze
Someday I'll ask you will you marry me
'Cause I can see us be the birds and the bees
Start a little family

'Cause I've been searching near and far
Drinking on forever in these small town bars
But sippin' from your lips got me falling hard
No I shouldn't drive take the key to my heart
